## 0. Summary
- Firka does not store any data on servers - all data remains only on your device.
- The data comes from the KRÃ‰TA system, which is the original data controller.
- Firka only displays the data and does not have access to critical information such as your password.
- When reporting bugs, YOU decide whether to share screenshots or logs - these are deleted after the issue is resolved.
- If you want to modify or delete your data stored in KRÃ‰TA, you can do so through your school or the KRÃ‰TA customer service.

## 1. Introduction
The Firka NaplÃ³ (hereinafter: "application" or "Firka") aims to present student data retrieved from the KRÃ‰TA system in a clear and organized way on the user's device.

## 2. Data Controller Identification
**Data Controller:** Firka Management Team (not a legal entity)  

**Contact email:** legal+english@firka.app  

Note: the team does not wish to make individual members' personal data public; all data protection matters can be handled via the email above.  

DPO (Data Protection Officer): **not appointed**. For privacy matters, please contact the email above.

## 3. What data we process and from where
The application displays the following data obtained from the KRÃ‰TA system and stores it locally on the user's device:
- student profile data (name, student identification number [OM identifier], school information),
- timetable,
- grades,
- school messages and notifications.

These data are **not stored on Firka's servers**, only locally on the user's device.

## 4. Where your data is stored and its security
- The application communicates with KRÃ‰TA servers over an encrypted channel (HTTPS).
- The retrieved data is stored only on the user's device and is **not transmitted to third parties** (except KRÃ‰TA and related service providers for bug reporting purposes) for marketing or storage.
- Developers do not have access to users' login passwords - these are not stored by the application.

Security measures: we apply encrypted communication, minimal access, and limited data retention during bug handling (see below).

## 5. Purposes of data processing and legal basis
1. **Displaying KRÃ‰TA data in the application** - purpose: main function of the app (performance of a contract with the user). **Legal basis:** performance of a contract (GDPR Article 6 (1) b)) or the explicit request of the user to use the application. *These data are stored temporarily only on the user's device, and neither the app developers nor third parties have access. The Firka Management Team (as the data controller) does not have access to these data in any form.*

2. **Handling bug reports** - purpose: improving the operation of the application. **Legal basis:** the explicit consent of the user (GDPR Article 6 (1) a)), as users voluntarily share data (e.g., screenshots or logs) during bug reporting.

3. **Handling necessary technical logs (ensuring regular operation)** - purpose: operational/logging reasons (short-term bug tracking). **Legal basis:** legitimate interest (GDPR Article 6 (1) f)), but only for minimal time and purpose-bound.

## 6. Data retention period
- **Locally stored KRÃ‰TA data:** remains on the device until the user deletes the application. Users can delete locally stored data at any time.
- **Bug reports / logs (Discord / TestFlight):** bug reports are stored only for the duration of problem resolution and are deleted immediately after the issue is closed. (Upon user request, deletion can be carried out earlier.)

## 7. Data transfer to third parties and international transfers
- **KRÃ‰TA (Educational Development Zrt.):** the application retrieves data from KRÃ‰TA systems - they are the original data controllers.
- **Bug reports:** on Android, bug reports may be uploaded to the developers via the Discord server; on iOS, feedback may be sent through TestFlight/Apple (according to Apple's data handling practices). These are third-party services, which may involve international data transfer (e.g., Apple, Discord infrastructure abroad). In such cases, the service provider (e.g., Discord, Apple) is responsible for compliance, and necessary legal safeguards (e.g., adequate data protection measures) are applied.
- **Marketing or analytics:** the application does not transfer data to third parties for marketing or analytics purposes.

## 8. Rights of the data subject
The data subject has the following rights:
- **Right of access** to personal data processed about them,
- **Right to rectification** (correct inaccurate data),
- **Right to erasure** ("right to be forgotten") if no legal reason exists to continue processing,
- **Right to restriction of processing**,
- **Right to data portability** (if processing is automated in a structured, machine-readable format and based on contract or consent),
- **Right to object** to the processing of personal data, especially in the case of legitimate interest,
- **Right to withdraw consent** (if processing is based on consent), affecting future processing but not the lawfulness of prior processing.

To exercise these rights, please send an email to **legal+english@firka.app**. We will respond within a reasonable time, but no later than 1 month; in complex cases, the response period may be extended by 2 months, with notification.

**Important:** KRÃ‰TA is responsible for the management and retention of data stored in its system. Firka only displays these data on the device and does not store them on its servers. Therefore, any modifications or deletions must be done via your school administrator's assistance or KRÃ‰TA customer service.

## 9. Complaints and legal remedies
If a data subject believes their rights have been violated, they may file a complaint with the supervisory authority:

**National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH)**
- Address: 1055 Budapest, Falk Miksa Street 9-11
- Website: www.naih.hu
- Email: ugyfelszolgalat@naih.hu
- Mailing address: 1363 Budapest, Pf.: 9

The data subject may also seek remedies through the courts.

## 10. Automated decision-making and profiling
The application does not perform automated decision-making or profiling that would have legal effects on the data subject.

## 11. Other provisions
- Policy updates: this privacy policy may be updated as needed; important changes will be notified within the application and on Firka servers (news).
- Contact: all data protection inquiries can be sent to **legal+english@firka.app**.
